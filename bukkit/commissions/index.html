title: Bukkit Plugin Commissions
---

I currently offer a private Bukkit plugin development service for a fee.

Basically, the process goes like this:
<br />
<ol>
    <li>You request a plugin via <a href="http://st28.me/pluginrequest">my plugin request form</a>.</li>
    <li>I contact you via the contact information provided in the form and I give you a price quote.</li>
    <li>Work on the plugin begins once a price is agreed on.</li>
    <li>The plugin is finished and loaded on my test server.</li>
    <li>If the plugin requires changes, I will make them. If not, we proceed to payment.</li>
    <li>Once I verify that payment has been received, I will give you a link to a folder on my <a href="https://www.box.com/">Box</a> folder containing the plugin jar archive and documentation.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Payments</h3>
I currently only accept PayPal for payments. Payments must be sent PRIOR to me sending the completed plugin.<br />
<br />
If a plugin's cost is $40-50 or more, I will sometimes require an initial payment to guarantee that you really want the plugin.  I've completed large plugins before but wasn't paid because the clients "lost interest".

<h3>What's Included?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Plugin JAR archive.</li>
    <li>File containing documentation on the plugin's commands, permissions, configuration, and so on.</li>
    <li>Source code on request.</li>
    <li>Plugin setup and/or configuration on your server (by request).
    <li>Assistance if you encounter configuration problems.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Licensing</h3>

<i>Note that I will not distribute the plugin myself unless you (the client) specifically allow me to.</i>

<h4>What You CAN Do:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Use the plugin on any number of your own servers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What You CANNOT Do:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Resell the plugin. I won't give out your private plugin(s) to other people, so I would appreciate you doing the same for me. If you wish to resell it, let me know and I will give you a portion of the resale price for referring a customer to me.</li>
    <li>Distribute the plugin freely. If you want the plugin to be freely available, let me know and I will upload it to Spigot, BukkitDev, etc.</li>
    <li>Claim the plugin as your own. Development is not an easy task, so I would appreciate it if you didn't take credit that belongs to me.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Updates & Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bug fixes are free.</li>
    <li>Minor updates/changes are free. (change a line of text, add a simple configuration option, etc.)</li>
    <li>Larger updates may require an extra fee, as determined by me.</li>
</ul>
