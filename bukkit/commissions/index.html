title: Bukkit Plugin Commissions
---

I currently offer a private Bukkit plugin development service for a fee.

Basically, the process goes like this.
<br />
<ol>
    <li>A person asks me to develop a plugin for them and provides a description of the plugin they want.</li>
    <li>I read over the request and decide whether or not to accept it.  If I accept it, I will give an estimate on how much I will charge for it.</li>
    <li>If the person agrees to my estimate (or we agree on a different price via discussion), I require them to read over and accept the information on this page.  If they agree, I will create the plugin.</li>
    <li>Once the plugin is complete, I will load it up on my private testing server and give the person access to the server so they can demo the new plugin.</li>
    <li>If the plugin requires changes, I will make them.  If not, we proceed to payment.</li>
    <li>Once I verify that I received the payment, I will send the person the plugin along with documentation on commands, permissions, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Payments</h3>
I currently only accept PayPal for payments.<br />
<br />
If a plugin's cost is $40-50 or more, I will sometimes require an initial payment to guarantee that you really want the plugin.  I've completed large plugins before but wasn't paid because the clients "lost interest".

<h3>What's Included?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Plugin JAR archive.</li>
    <li>File containing documentation on the plugin's commands, permissions, configuration, and so on.</li>
    <li>Plugin setup and/or configuration on your server (by request).
    <li>Assistance if you encounter configuration problems.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Licensing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The source code of the plugin belongs to me.  After a set amount of time, I may decide to send you the source on request.  However, this is not always guaranteed.</li>
    <li>You may not resell any plugins I create for you.  I won't give out your private plugins to other people, so I would appreciate you doing the same for me.  If you wish to resell it, let me know and I will give you a portion of the resale price for referring a customer to me.</li>
    <li>You cannot upload any plugins I create for you to BukkitDev or any other file hosting.  If you're fine with the plugin being distributed freely, I will host them myself.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Updates</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bug fixes are free.  I dun goofed and it's my responsibility to fix my mistakes.</li>
    <li>I usually won't charge for minor updates to a plugin (change a line of text, add a configuration option).</li>
    <li>The cost of larger updates will be determined by me after you explain the update to me.</li>
</ul>
