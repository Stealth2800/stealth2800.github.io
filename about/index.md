Greetings!  I'm Austin, better known as Stealth2800 online.

My first experience with any form of programming was nearly seven years ago using [Scratch][0].  About four years after that, I began learning object-oriented programming using ActionScript 3 in conjunction with the Adobe Flash IDE.  Just over a year and a half ago, I moved over to Java with my focus set on the [Bukkit][1] server mod for [Minecraft][2].  Since then, I have made many plugins, both free, open-source plugins and private, commercial plugins.

At some point, I want to begin to learn C++ and get into game development using that.  My experience with Java has been limited to Bukkit, so I do not have very much experience developing standalone applications and games in Java.
